Library Management app 

Uses Python as the GUI 


## Project Scope and Features
This app will manage the check-in and check-out of books using:
- QR Code Scanning (via webcam)
- NFC Tag Scanning (via NFC reader for the physical books  ) 
- Manual Book ID Entry
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) (built with Tkinter)
- Backend Logic in C++ for database management 


### Library_Backend.cpp
C++ as the Backend
This file will handle the logic for adding, checking in, and checking out books. This logic will be linked to the Python frontend using a Python-C++ integration.
